# Annotorious Magnetic Path

A plugin that adds a _magnetic pen_-style path selection tool to [Annotorious](https://annotorious.com).

Uses the excellent [OpenCV.js intelligent scissors implementation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.5/d9/df5/tutorial_js_intelligent_scissors.html) 
and the [Simplify.js](https://github.com/mourner/simplify-js/) polyline simplification library under the hood.
